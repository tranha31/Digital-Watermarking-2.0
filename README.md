# Digital-Watermarking-2.0

Copyright protection of digital photos is an essential requirement for the creator of the photo. With the use of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) technique on the frequency domain, we have added each signature bit (watermark) to the image without changing the original color of the image. 

This is a simple web application to watermark image with fixed signature size (25 characters)
